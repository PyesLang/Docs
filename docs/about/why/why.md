# Why Pyes

You may be asking yourself, "why would I use this over any 'real' language?".

Well, currently, you probably shouldn't...

But that doesn't mean I'm not trying to develop something awesome and useful.
Guess you'll just have to stay and find out 'ey.

## N.B

One thing to note throughout this is that I will have opinions.
They are maybe not extremely fleshed-out at the current time of reading and you may disagree.

That is fine, I'm sure many people will disagree with parts or all of what I think.
If it is something that you're passionate about, then I'd love to discuss this in a kind manner.

If you think I'm factually wrong and want to correct me, then I'd gladly welcome it.
But do so with decorum and grace, and actually have evidence and not just presenting "your opinion" as fact.
