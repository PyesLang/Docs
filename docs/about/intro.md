# Introduction

Welcome to Pyes, a new language being designed and developed by me ([Samuel Trew](https://github.com/SamuelTrew/)).

I am trying to design Pyes through taking inspiration from modern programming languages and from my own experience (albeit minimal)

- `Rust`
- `Python`
- `TypeScript`

You will probably see elements of all of them throughout this [About](why.md) section and the docs in general.
Hopefully, as I take you on a journey, it will become apparent as to each and every design decision made.
